# Movies-ETL

## Overview
In this project we examined the ETL process. We created an ETL function to extract, transform, and load data. In the project we extracted several datasets, cleaned them, and added them to a database in PostgreSQL. In the process we transformed a JSON file, reformated columns, changes datatypes where necessary, and merged datasets from different sources. In the final section we combined all of the techniques into a function that could easily be called for new data.
