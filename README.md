# Movies-ETL

## Overview
In this project, we followed the ETL process to go through the process of creating a product from data. we extracted sevral datasets, cleaned them, and added them to a database in PostgreSQL. In the process we transformed a JSON file, reformated columns, changes datatypes where necessary, and merged datasets from different sources. In the final section we combined all of the techniques into function that could easily be called for new data.
